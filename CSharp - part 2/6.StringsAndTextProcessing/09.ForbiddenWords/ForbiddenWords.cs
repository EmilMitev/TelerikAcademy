    We are given a string containing a list of forbidden words and a text containing some of these words.
    Write a program that replaces the forbidden words with asterisks.
    Example text: Microsoft announced its next generation PHP compiler today. It is based on .NET Framework 4.0 and is implemented as a dynamic language in CLR.
    Forbidden words: PHP, CLR, Microsoft
    The expected result: ********* announced its next generation *** compiler today. It is based on .NET Framework 4.0 and is implemented as a dynamic language in ***.
